# Task
The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3 x 3 grid with 8 square tiles labelled 1 through 8, plus a blank square.
The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically into the blank square.

A. Develop a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem using Hill Climbing algorithm, by following the requirements below: 
• When the program is executed, simple introduction about the program should be displayed, before prompt the user for next course of action 
• Program should prompt the user to: 
  o Choose which algorithm to run
  o Enter initial state and goal state
• After getting input from user, program should ask user to confirm the initial state and goal state entered which displayed in matrix 
• Check for invalid input entered by user 
• Let the user to run the program again without exit from the program 

B. Write a detailed discussion which includes: 
• Result 
  o Test cases must be prepared using 2 possible initial states. 
• Effectiveness of searching 
  o Execution time
